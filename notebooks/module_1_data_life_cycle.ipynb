    "The Research Data Life Cycle (RDLC) enables us to visualize and map the different phases through which research data need to go. Several schemes and interpretations of a RDLC exist, but they all share the same general flow: data is collected to gather information, this information leads to knowledge and this in its turn leads to wisdom.\n",

    "This module will introduce you to the different phases of the Research Data Life Cycle (RDLC) and briefly explain what each of these phases generally encompasses. In the following modules, each phase of the RDLC will be dealt with in more detail, with specific aspects and best practices thoroughly explained. "
