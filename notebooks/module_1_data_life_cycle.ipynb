    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Research Data Life Cycle (RDLC) enables the visualisation and mapping of the different steps research data go through. This in its turn allows us to associate these steps with short-term and long-term data management requirements. Several schemes and interpretations of a RDLC exist. Although different, they all share the same general concepts and flow, which is the following: data is collected to gather information, this information brings knowledge and from this knowledge, we evolve to wisdom. This flow is also known as the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom model, or DIKW pyramid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is very valuable. It is collected for a reason, and collecting data requires financial support. Data and information is therefore seen as one of the most valuable assets of an institute, organisation, university, company, together with the people working there. However, without continuous efforts to maintain order in the data, chances are high that you end up in ‘data chaos’ or ‘data entropy’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look into the concept of chaos or entropy a little. Just close your eyes and picture your living room, closet, basement, garage, attic, kitchen cupboards, storage room, … Are these places well organised, where you can immediately find things, and don’t have any problem with neatly storing new things? Then you are a fine and talented organisor or manager! However, what are the odds that at least one of these places corresponds to a location where you randomly introduce new things, or just dump things from other locations because they don’t belong there anymore, and after a while you can not find that one item of which you are absolutely certain you stored it there? Welcome to chaos, or entropy. Now have an objective look at your computer, and how you store files… What do you think? Order or chaos? Or ‘organised chaos’, if you still find your way around your files, but it would be impossible for someone else? Welcome to the world of ‘data chaos’ or ‘data entropy’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, project the way you organize your files on your laptop to the scale of an institute. The chaos or entropy level becomes much higher, and a lot harder to manage if a basic structure is missing. And no, data chaos is not an IT-problem, for data engineers or data architects to deal with. Data organization needs to happen at all levels, and it starts with proper instructions and guidance to all who collect data and work with the data, throughout the full life cycle of the data at hand. And this is also part of the Research Data Life Cycle, ensuring a certain level of order, to avoid data chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "A wide variety of books and articles have already been written on the topic of the Research Data Life Cycle. What is obvious from all these, is that planning is crucial, and this needs to be done in the very early stage of the life cycle, even prior to the start of the actual research or project. In this planning phase, the Data Management Plan (DMP) needs to be compiled, which has even become a mandatory document for many grant applications and funding agencies. The Data Management Plan specifies how data will be handled both during and after a project has ended. As this Data Management Plan is such an essential component, this will be addressed in detail in Module 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The research data lifecycle: What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "The research data lifecycle is a key concept within Research Data Management (RDM). It describes the different stages research data go through before, during, and after a research project. Various data management activities take place within each stage of the data lifecycle, and the choices made in one stage influence the next one.

    "\n",
    "The number of phases defined in the Research Data Life Cycle (RDLC) may vary from source to source, depending on how people look at it. No matter how many phases are defined (possibly 5 to 8), the concepts and key-topics remain the same. Exceptions can always exist, where one or more of the stages do not apply to the available data.\n",
